## Motivation

When I was 21, I got my first Fitbit watch, and I was constantly curious about the amazing function that had been released. Activity tracking was one of the features. When the same feature was released in Apple and later Android devices, I was perplexed. This kept me on my toes, and I learned that the data came from the sensors, but I had no idea what types of sensors there were or what the underlying mechanism was. I was taught all of the necessary topics to develop the same underlying technology that I fantasized about throughout my late childhood thanks to Prof. Christopher McGraw's course.

## Objectives
1. To use classification models to classify multinomial variables that is 6 degrees
2. Use of  dimension reduction techniques on models
